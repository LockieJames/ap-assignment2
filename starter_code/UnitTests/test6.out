> HELP!
Feeling a little stuck? Here are your options: 
Write: 
place (colour of the tile you want to place)(shape you want to place) at (selected row)(selected column) 
	 This could for instance look like [38;5;126m"place P4 at D5"[0m
	 Be careful however, you are allowed to place tiles only next to one that already exists
	 and has the same shape or colour!
	 Additionally, you can place only the tiles that are in you hand!

replace (colour of tile)(shape of tile)
	 This will replace the tile you choose and you will get a new one from the bag.
	 Could look like [38;5;126m"replace Y2"[0m

save (filename)
	 Will save the game into the file you provided.

quit
	 Will quit the game.

^D
	 Will quit the game as well.

help
	 Opens this.
